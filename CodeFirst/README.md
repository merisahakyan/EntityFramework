# Code First
This scenario includes targeting a database that doesnâ€™t exist and Code First will create, or an empty database <br/>
that Code First will add new tables too. Code First allows you to define your model using C# or VB.Net classes.<br/>
Additional configuration can optionally be performed using attributes on your classes and properties or by using a fluent API.<br/>
[This video and step-by-step walkthrough provide an introduction to Code First development targeting a new database.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj193542(v=vs.113).aspx)
